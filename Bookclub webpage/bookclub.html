			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Author:</strong> Frekrik Backman</p>
			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			<p>At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets.</p>
			<p>But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so?</p>

			<p><strong>Author:</strong> James Clear</p>
			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			<p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.</p>
			<p>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p>

			<p><strong>Author:</strong> Jane Austen</p>
			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			<p>Pride and Prejudice is a comedy of manners centered around the Bennet family, a family of five daughters where the parents are desperate for at least one of them to make a wealthy match and save the next generation from destitution. Austen's story engages with the tension between marrying for love, rather than wealth or social prestige, and the pressure to assure financial security. Originally published in 1813, Pride and Prejudice is one of the best-loved and best-selling novels in English literature of all time.</p>
			<p>Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist known for her novels about the British landed gentry and the social, economic, and romantic pressures faced by young women. Her comic wit and use of irony and literary realism have given her novels remarkable staying power, remaining as relevant and meaningful to readers today as during her own time.</p>
